# landing-page-project
For this project I will have to edit html file and integrate css filr in to it.
This is a first full project I am working on since I began learning from 
The Odin Project. I guess html part of the project won't be that hard but
for the css it is probably expected to use flexbox for alignment since the 
project is in this part of curriculum. After the project is finished I'll 
come back and try to explain the workflow.

So, I have finished the project and did my best to make it look as similar to 
the image as posible. I used mostly flexbox properties for positioning of the 
elements on the page and as far as I am concerned it looks ok. I am satisfied
with the end result. I haven't used any flex-grow or shrink properties and I
think for the future challenges it would be nice to include those as well.
