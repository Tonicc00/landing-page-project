# landing-page-project
For this project I will have to edit html file and integrate css filr in to it.
This is a first full project I am working on since I began learning from 
The Odin Project. I guess html part of the project won't be that hard but
for the css it is probably expected to use flexbox for alignment since the 
project is in this part of curriculum. After the project is finished I'll 
come back and try to explain the workflow.
